    <div class="large"><i>MY STORY</i></div>
    <div class="space-medium"></div>
    <p>I'd love to share my metaharmony story with you</p>
    <p>Let's start with a timeline:</p>
    <div class="space-medium"></div>
    <img src="images/full.png" class="standard-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
    <div class="space-large"></div>
    <p>It seems there's 5 chapters to this journey so far:</p>
    <div class="space-medium"></div>
    <h1>Chapter 1: Grasping a dream</h1>
    <img src="images/chp1.png" class="standard-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
    <div class="space-medium"></div>
    <p>After finishing the harmony modules of my music degree</p>
    <p>I discovered the work of Barry Harris and I developed this sense that all harmony was connected</p>
    <p>And by playing different harmonic movements and changing keys we are traversing a physical landscape</p>
    <br>
    <p><i>“What does this landscape look like?”</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>Seeking the answer to this question was very dreamlike</p>
    <p>And after about 20 months of research and a few conversations with friends,</p>
    <p>the meta prism and colour wheel were complete</p>
    <div class="space-large"></div>
    <h1>Chapter 2: Recovery</h1>
    <img src="images/chp2.png" class="standard-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
    <div class="space-medium"></div>
    <p>During these 20 months I became unwell and took roughly a year to recover my health.</p>
    <p>With the help of my friend Charlie, we organised my ideas</p>
    <p>and coined the term metaharmony</p>
    <div class="space-large"></div>
    <h1>Chapter 3: Development</h1>
    <img src="images/chp3.png" class="standard-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
    <div class="space-medium"></div>
    <p><i>What am I going to do with this? I need to share it with the world."</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>I started a YouTube channel</p>
    <p>This was a productive time of learning how to produce content,</p>
    <p>explore and communicate metaharmony</p>
    <p>Metaharmony is not just an idea, but a tool to be used</p>
    <p>and in this season I grew in how to harness its creative potential.</p>
    <div class="space-large"></div>
    <h1>Chapter 4: Yielding</h1>
    <img src="images/chp4.png" class="standard-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
    <div class="space-medium"></div>
    <p>This is a delicate and personal moment, let me try and explain...</p>
    <div class="space-medium"></div>
    <p>During this time of YouTube development, I had become rather obsessed with the idea of ‘succeeding’</p>
    <p>making meta harmony into an online business and conquering the world with it</p>
    <br>
    <p>But in April 2023, I picked up a leaflet that had the Lord’s prayer on it</p>
    <p>and it stired my spirit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I thought,</p>
    <p><i>“What if God is listening, and I pray this prayer and He actually responds</i></p>
    <p><i>what might happen?”</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>I started earnestly praying this simple prayer everyday</p>
    <p>focusing to really mean each line</p>
    <p>and started developing a sense of God’s presence</p>
    <p>but in these moments I felt God wasn’t happy with some of things in my life</p>
    <p>I was convicted.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After a few months of squirming under this feeling I finally said,</p>
    <p><i>“God, I’m ready”</i></p>
    <p>And that weekend God led me in making some changes in my life</p>
    <p>which involved destroying all the work I had done over the last 5-6 years</p>
    <p>the YouTube was permanently deleted</p>
    <p>all my back up files wiped</p>
    <p>and my laptop was in a binbag with a pint of water. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>My friend Meg calls this “The Laptism”</h3>
    <p>(laptop baptism…)</p>
    <br>
    <p>After this complete surrender I felt inner healing like I never knew was possible</p>
    <p>hard compacted pain and pride melted into joy and peace.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The next day I received a vision of a tiny plant sprouting out of the ashes</p>
    <p>I knew meta harmony would rise again</p>
    <br>
    <p>The next 18 months were a time of rest and spiritual growth</p>
    <p>I joined a church where I met my friend Sam who I told my story to and he said,</p>
    <br>
    <p><i>“I’ve got a laptop in my cupboard and I haven’t sold it</i></p>
    <p><i>because I sensed that God wanted me to give it to someone</i></p>
    <p><i>I feel that you are that person”</i></p>
    <div class="space-large"></div>
    <h1>Chapter 5: Regrowing</h1>
    <img src="images/chp5.png" class="standard-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
    <div class="space-medium"></div>
    <p>So here we are at the beginning of 2025</p>
    <p>and I am using said Laptop to create this website</p>
    <p>It seems the little metaharmony plant is growing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It’s an absolute joy to continue working on metaharmony,</p>
    <p>but nothing it can offer compares to the promise of Jesus: </p>
    <p>Eternal life with him</p>
    <br>
    <h3><i>“Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again.</i></h3>
    <h3><i>The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water</i></h3>
    <h3><i>welling up to eternal life.” - John 4: 14</i></h3>
    <br>
    <p>I would encourage everyone to investigate the claims of Jesus in the Bible</p>
    <p>(By reading the book of John for example)</p>
    <p>and put thier faith in him.</p>
    <p>Doing this will give you two things:</p>
    <br>
    <p>1. The promise of eternal life</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. The journey of sanctification in this life:</p>
    <p>where we get moulded by God over time to be more full of his love and truth</p>
    <p>This then overflows into into every area of your life over time</p>
    <p>To my knowledge, I can’t tell you of anything better in all of life</p>
    <br>
    <h3>But as for meta harmony,</h3>
    <p>I believe it has potential to be a fruitful tool for the right type of musician,</p>
    <p>So do stay tuned if you're interested</p>
    <br>
    <p>Many thanks,</p>
    <p>Tom</p>
