        <h1><i>METAPRISM</i></h1>
        <div class="space-medium"></div>
        <p>This is the metaprism, it holds all possible harmony in and between all keys:</p>
        <div class="space-medium"></div>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/MP.png" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <div class="space-medium"></div>
        <p>There's nothing we can do in western harmony that isn't encapsulated by the metaprism</p>
        <p>We can start in any key, use any chords in that key, and change into any other key.</p>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <h2><i>Step 1: A ring of Hypercubes</i></h2>
        <p>The metaprism simply joins the hypercubes together:</p>
        <div class="space-medium"></div>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/allHcspin.gif" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <h2>How exactly?</h2>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <p>Ok, Here's a familiar hypercube, but we stretch the inner cube like this:</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/stretch.gif" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <p>Nothing about the hypercube has been changed</p>
        <p>We still have the purple alpha cube and its four chords for example:</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/stretchpurples.gif" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <p>The purple cube has just been squished flat.</p>
        <p>Same for the green cube below</p>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <h3>This allows us to join two hypercubes together:</h3>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/splitjoin.gif" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <p>We can see how the purple cube is part of both hypercubes</p>
        <h3>This is how the metaprism is constructed</h3>
        <p>We can see our joined orange and green hypercubes forming part of the metaprism</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/sharedpurple.png" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <p>This is how the hypercubes join around the whole metaprism:</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/allHcspin.gif" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <h1><i>Inside out hypercubes</i></h1>
        <p>All the hypercubes we've seen have the tonic cube (green) in the middle,</p>
        <p>and the complimentary diminished cube (red) on the outside:</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/greeninnie.png" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <p>Heres a IV V I with green in the middle:</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/innie451.gif" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <p>Heres a IV V I with green on the outside:</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/outie451.gif" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <h2>Both hypercubes are exactly the same, it's like an inside out tee shirt</h2>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <p>In the metaprism, these three hypercubecubes have their tonics in the middle:</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/MPinnies.png" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <p>and these three hypercubes have their tonics on the outside:</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/MPouties.png" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <p>After a bit of study it gets really easy to quickly identify the hypercubes and whether they're innies or outies</p>
        <h3>A quick tip:</h3>
        <p>look at a hypercube, what colour is the centre cube?</p>
        <p>A secondary colour? then thats your tonic</p>
        <p>or is it a primary colour? then thats the complementary colour of your tonic</p>
        <p>or do this by looking at the outer cube</p>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <h1>Step 3</h1>
        <h3>Final thought, the metaprism has two of each hypercube</h3>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/duplicates.gif" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <p>We have an innie and an outie of each hypercube</p>
        <p>They're duplicated so the meta prism can connect in the proper way and allow for arcades</p>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
        <h2>We've just built and visualised the metaprism</h2>
        <p>Stay on this page and meditate on the visualisations for as long as need</p>
        <p>and do return to it as often as you feel the need</p>
        <p>These pages are meant to be returned to and studied over and over</p>
        <p>There's always more to see in these shapes</p>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <h1><i>Let's have some music!</i></h1>
        <p>Here's a simple progression turning chord iii (dominant) in C major into chord ii (subdominant) In D major:</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/iiitoii.gif" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <div class="space-medium"></div>
        <div class="audio-player-container">
            <div class="audio-title">C^7 Em7 D^7</div>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="../audio/CEmD.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>
        </div>
        <div class="space-medium"></div>
        <p>Hear how E minor sounds like chord iii in C but retrospectivly sounds like chord ii in D major</p>
        <h3><i>We've shifted from the orange hypercube to the green one</i></h3>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <p>Check out the cookbook page on doing more with this specific idea:</p>
        <div class="space-medium"></div>
        <a href="../cookbook/metaprismkeychanges/iitoiii.html"class="nav-style">ii to iii</a>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <p>This idea stayed within one arcade (see next page)</p>
        <p>But we can also traverse the metaprism across multiple arcades like this:</p>
        <img src="../imagesgeo/CtoGviaFm.gif" class="large-image" alt="Colour Wheel">
        <div class="space-medium"></div>
        <div class="audio-player-container">
            <div class="audio-title">C^7 Fm G^7</div>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="../audio/CtoGviaFm.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>
        </div>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <p>We start in C major, we grab Fm (the minor iv)</p>
        <p>This is all in the orange hypercube</p>
        <p>But we take that F minor and pivot into the purple hypercube</p>
        <p>This makes F minor a dominant chord, which we can resolve to any purple key</p>
        <p>So we choose G major, making F minor the minor backdoor</p>
        <p>Check out exploring the dominants in the cookbook to hear all these movements:</p>
        <div class="space-medium"></div>
        <a href="../cookbook/Exploringdominants/Exploringdominants.html"class="nav-style">Exploring the Dominants</a>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <p>Our progression has a few layers of complexity to it because we're using strong non diatonic chords between both keys</p>
        <p>We use a non diatonic chord in C (Fm)</p>
        <p>Turn that into a minor backdoor of G</p>
        <p>And we keep using the Fm in G</p>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <p>another thought: this progression could stay in the orange hypercube with G^7 being a dominant chord</p>
        <p>We could just resolve that G back to the key of C, this would mean everything would stay in the orange hypercube</p>
        <p>But we establish G major as the new tonic, which means we've traversed the metaprism and landed in the purple hypercube</p>
        <div class="space-large"></div>
        <h1>Ok</h1>
        <p>Once we feel comfortable indentifying the <b>hypercubes</b> in the metaprism we're ready to see the arcades</p>
